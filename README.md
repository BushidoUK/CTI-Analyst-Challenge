# CTI Analyst Challenge
- This repository can be used as an analytical challenge that was created to test analysts looking to try performing proactive cyber threat intelligence activities.
- The repository contains several resources to get started (see below).
- Analysts need to review them and peform tasks to complete and fulfil their demo client's priority intelligence requirements.

| Resource | Description | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| [Proactive CTI Diagram](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/Proactive%20CTI%20Diagram.png) | A diagram explaining the process involved in taking intelligence sources and satisfying stakeholder priority intelligence requirements (PIRs). |  Use this as a guide to understand the order of tasks you need to perform in a real-world scenario when working in a CTI team. |
| [Reactive CTI Diagram](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/Reactive%20CTI%20Diagram.png) | A diagram explaing the process involved in taking incident artifacts and satisfying stakeholder requests for intelligence (RFIs). | Use this as a guide to understand the order of tasks you need to perform in a real-world scenario when working in a CTI team. |
| [Demo Stakeholders](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/DemoStakeholders.md) | A list of fictional organisations that you are to use to practice fulfilling their PIRs and RFIs. | Imagine that these organisations are your clients (if you're an MSSP) or the company that work for. Your job as an analyst is to protect these entities and help them defend from emerging threats. |
