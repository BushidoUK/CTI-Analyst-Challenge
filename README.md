# CTI Analyst Challenge
- This repository can be used as an analytical challenge that was created to test analysts looking to try performing proactive cyber threat intelligence activities.
- The repository contains several resources to get started (see below).
- Analysts need to review them and peform tasks to complete and fulfil their demo client's priority intelligence requirements.

| Resource | Description | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| [Proactive CTI Diagram](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/Proactive%20CTI%20Diagram.png) | A diagram explaining the process involved in taking intelligence sources and satisfying stakeholder priority intelligence requirements (PIRs). |  Use this as a guide to understand the order of tasks you need to perform in a real-world scenario when working in a CTI team. |
| [Reactive CTI Diagram](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/Reactive%20CTI%20Diagram.png) | A diagram explaing the process involved in taking incident artifacts and satisfying stakeholder requests for intelligence (RFIs). | Use this as a guide to understand the order of tasks you need to perform in a real-world scenario when working in a CTI team. |
| [Demo Stakeholders](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/DemoStakeholders.md) | A list of fictional organisations that analysts are to use to practice fulfilling their PIRs using the `Intelligence Sources` and their RFIs using the `Demo Incident Artifacts` provided below. | Imagine that these organisations are your clients or the company that work for. Your job as an analyst is to protect these entities and help them defend from emerging threats. |
| [Intelligence Sources](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/IntelligenceSources.md) | A collection of threat reports and articles that need to be checked for relevence for their chosen organisation(s). | Analysts need to scan through, understand, and extract the most important information from the threat reports and articles to provide actionable threat intelligence. Follow the `Proactive CTI Diagram` steps. |
| [Demo Incident Artifacts](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/DemoIncidentArtifacts.md) | A collection of Indicators and Compromise (IOCs) taken from real attacks but have been provided to simulate an RFI that a real-world stakeholder (such as a SOC or DFIR team) provided the CTI team for additional context and recommendations. | Analysts need to triage, research, and assess the IOCs, artifacts, and incident details and provide a response to the stakeholder that support their actions while handling the incident. Follow the `Reactive CTI Diagram` steps. |
