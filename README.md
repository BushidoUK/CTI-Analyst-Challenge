# CTI Analyst Challenge
- This repository contains instructions and resources for an intelligence analysis challenge
- It was created to test cyber threat intelligence (CTI) analysts looking to practice performing proactive and reactive CTI tasks.
- CTI analysts need to review them and peform tasks to complete and fulfil their demo client's priority intelligence requirements (PIRs) and requests for intelligence (RFIs).

--- 

### Getting Started
- Analysts can decide whether they want to begin with proactive CTI challenge or the reactive CTI challenge

- **Proactive CTI Challenge:**
  - To begin the proactive CTI challenge, analysts need to review the `Proactive CTI Diagram`, the `Demo Stakeholders`, and the `Intelligence Sources`.
  - Analysts then need to follow the steps laid out in the diagram to think about stakeholder PIRs and then review the intelligence sources.
  - CTI Incident Reports then need to be written by the analysts to meet the PIRs of their chosen stakeholder.
  - Analysts can use the `CTI Incident Report Template` provided.
 
- **Reactive CTI Challenge:**
  - To begin the reactive CTI challenge, analysts need to review the `Reactive CTI Diagram`, the `Demo Stakeholders`, and the `Demon Incident Artifacts`.
  - Analysts then need to follow the steps laid out in the diagram to think about the stakeholder's RFIs and then review the incident artifacts.
  - A reponse to the RFI then needs to be written by the analysts to fulfil the RFI made by their chosen stakeholder.
  - While reviewing the artifacts, analysts need to provide context about the threat, such as the level of danger it poses to the target organisations.
  - It is also advisable to provide potential Courses of Action (CoAs) to support requesting stakeholders while they are investigating incidents.
  - Analysts can use the `RFI Response Template` provided.

- **Additional Notes:**
  - The way your reports are written may also depend on the type of organisation you are a CTI analyst for.
  - Analysts who work for a vendor with many clients may frame their reports differently than in-house CTI teams that work full time for the same single organisation.
  - For this challenge, it is recommended to write the reports in the format you are used to or want to get better at.

### Resources

| Resource | Description | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| [Proactive CTI Diagram](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/Diagrams/Proactive%20CTI%20Diagram.png) | A diagram explaining the process involved in taking intelligence sources and satisfying stakeholder priority intelligence requirements (PIRs). |  Use this as a guide to understand the order of tasks you need to perform in a real-world scenario when working in a CTI team. |
| [Reactive CTI Diagram](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/Diagrams/Reactive%20CTI%20Diagram.png) | A diagram explaing the process involved in taking incident artifacts and satisfying stakeholder requests for intelligence (RFIs). | Use this as a guide to understand the order of tasks you need to perform in a real-world scenario when working in a CTI team. |
| [Demo Stakeholders](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/Demos/DemoStakeholders.md) | A list of fictional organisations that analysts are to use to practice fulfilling their PIRs using the `Intelligence Sources` and their RFIs using the `Demo Incident Artifacts` provided below. | Imagine that these organisations are your clients or the company that work for. Your job as an analyst is to protect these entities and help them defend from emerging threats. |
| [Demo Intelligence Sources](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/Demos/DemoIntelligenceSources.md) | A collection of threat reports and articles that need to be checked for relevence for their chosen organisation(s). | Analysts need to scan through, understand, and extract the most important information from the threat reports and articles to provide actionable threat intelligence. Follow the `Proactive CTI Diagram` steps. |
| [Demo Incident Artifacts](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/Demos/DemoIncidentArtifacts.md) | A collection of Indicators and Compromise (IOCs) taken from real attacks but have been provided to simulate an RFI that a real-world stakeholder (such as a SOC or DFIR team) provided the CTI team for additional context and recommendations. | Analysts need to triage, research, and assess the IOCs, artifacts, and incident details and provide a response to the stakeholder that support their actions while handling the incident. Follow the `Reactive CTI Diagram` steps. |
| [CTI Incident Report Template](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/Templates/CTI_IncidentReport_Template.md) | A basic report template to help write CTI Incident Reports. | Use the template as a guide to help perform proactive CTI activities. |
| [RFI Response Template](https://github.com/BushidoUK/CTI-Analyst-Challenge/blob/main/Templates/RFI_Response_Template.md) | A basic report template to help write RFI Response reports. | Use the template as a guide to help perform reactive CTI activities. |
